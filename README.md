> SeaSponge is an accessible web-based threat modeling tool developed for [Mozilla Winter of Security 2014](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Automation/WinterOfSecurity2014).

## About

This web-based application is being developed with three characteristics in mind:

- **Accessibility**: We want everyone to be able to map out their infrastructures and generate security reports on any operating-system and on any browser.
- **Aesthetics**: We're tired of clunky, boring interfaces - we want to bring the pizazz into threat-modeling.
- **Intuitive User-Experience**: We hate manuals, and we want you to be able to use this software without one.

Please see http://mozilla.github.io/seasponge/ for a live demo of the application.  
There is also a video on Air Mozilla available at https://air.mozilla.org/mozilla-winter-of-security-seasponge-a-tool-for-easy-threat-modeling/

### Docker

To build a docker image of this app, you must have docker installed first.
Run `docker build -t="seasponge-dev-1" .` on project root to setup project dependencies in the docker container.
Run `docker run it seasponge-dev-1` to enter into the container shell. You will still need to run `grunt serve` to actually bootstrap the app.
